## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my understanding of layout alignment using Flexbox and learned how to manage hover and focus states effectively to improve accessibility and user experience.

I also practiced writing cleaner, more structured HTML and organizing CSS for better readability and maintainability.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Focus more on accessibility (ARIA roles and keyboard navigation)
- Improve consistency in spacing and typography
- Write more reusable CSS
